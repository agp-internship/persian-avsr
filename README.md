Persian Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

This project is aimed to be a clone of the refrenced project in Persian. We are going to first retry all expriments of the paper (using the Github repository) and then start to build a dataset for this task in Persian (We would not do that from scratch - checkout the second reference). Then we may start to fine-tune the baseline model and reach to a Persian AVSR model.
